   <h2>About us</h2>

   <p>Activities, Attractions and Tours turned over USD 254BN in 2019.  
      Only 17% of bookings were made online. 
      Almost half (48%) of activity/tour/experience bookings happen while 
      travelers are at their destination and directly from the LOCAL 
      specific provider.  The in-destination segment remains the largest 
      travel segment that is not heavily penetrated on scale by larger providers.
   </p>
 
   <p>
      <span class="color-text">85% of travelers use mobile devices</span> 
      to book travel activities. Apps are nice, but travelers tend not 
      to have too many travel related apps as travel is not consumed very often, 
      and the provider of travel is often different from trip to trip. 
      If they do have the providers app (airlines-hotels-booking apps) 
      there is no real logic to use it whilst in-destination and push 
      notifications has not reached scale yet. 
      Emails are not regularly opened whilst on holiday and even if emails 
      are opened on mobile phones, the customer journey is not optimal for 
      a mobile environment. SMS has an open ratio of 95% and a response rate of 45%. 
      The traditional aggregator platforms are not optimal for finding the 
      right products when you are using your mobile and are in-destination. 
      There is too much choice.
   </p>
      
   <p>
      The inDest platform proactively sell targeted in-destination products 
      via SMS and dedicated micro-sites  when your traveler is at the destination.
   </p>


   <p>
      <strong>Imagine</strong> if you could proactively offer your traveler to book targeted indoor activities on a rainy day
   </p>

   <p>
      <strong>Imagine</strong> if you could proactively offer your traveler to book nearby restaurants with their favourite food for dinner tonight
   </p>

   <p>
      <strong>Imagine</strong> if you could proactively offer your traveler targeted in-destination products when they’re having breakfast
   </p>

   <p>
      <strong>Imagine</strong> if you could proactively offer your traveler the best transport options to the airport on the day they’re going home
   </p>
      
   <p>
      You can – the inDest platform proactively gives you the possibility 
      to offer tailor-made offers to the right audience at the right time.
   </p>

   <p>

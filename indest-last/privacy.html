   <p>

This would have been either by opting in, or by signing up via the newsletter sign up forms, or by opting in to receive information from inDest, via third party collaborative competitions.
   </p>

   <p>
      The channels for which an LIA (Legitimate Interest Assessment) has been conducted are as follows:
   </p>
